# AnyTS

![status: beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-yellow)

AnyTS is an experimental TypeScript runtime written in C/C++.  
It runs TypeScript without Node.js or Deno, focusing on speed and portability.

Note: `os.cpp` and `setup.cpp` are target-specific and may need to be replaced for different platforms.
